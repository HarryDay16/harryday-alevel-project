### Overview

Super Mario bros is a 2D side scrolling platformer that was developed by Nintendo in 1985. It has been one of the most successful and influential games of all time, and has defined the platformer genre.&#x20;

The aim of the game is to progress through all of the levels without dying, all while defeating different enemies and navigating the levels. A variety of different power ups can be picked up along the way, which can help the player to progress through the levels more easily. You start with a set amount of lives, and can gain more by collecting 100 coins, picking up a 1 up mushroom, or by bouncing on enemies consecutively. Mario loses a life if he takes damage while small, falls into a bottomless pit, or if the time runs out If you run out of lives then the game starts over from the last save point. This is a simple game concept, but has proved to be very popular&#x20;
