## Super Mario Bros

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (2).png>)

### Overview

Super Mario bros is a 2D side scrolling platformer that was developed by Nintendo in 1985. It has been one of the most successful and influential games of all time, and has defined the platformer genre. It was released before PEGI or ESRB were established so it doesn't have an age rating, but newer versions of the game have received  PEGI ratings of 3.

The aim of the game is to progress through all of the levels without dying, all while defeating different enemies and navigating the levels. A variety of different power ups can be picked up along the way, which can help the player to progress through the levels more easily. You start with a set amount of lives, and can gain more by collecting 100 coins, picking up a 1 up mushroom, or by bouncing on enemies consecutively. Mario loses a life if he takes damage while small, falls into a bottomless pit, or if the time runs out If you run out of lives then the game starts over from the last save point. This is a simple game concept, but has proved to be very popular over the years, as this game has sold more than 58 million copies since its release.[ (HP, 2021)](../reference-list.md)

The original Super Mario Bros was developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), so it used the NES gamepad as its controller. The D-pad on the left side of the controller is used for directional movement , the A button is used to jump or swim up and the B button is used to run or shoot a flame. This is a very simple and easy to use controller, which lowers the complexity of the game, making it more accessible for all groups of people.

| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enemies          | By adding enemies into the game it will  make it more challenging for the player, and give them another thing to think about. |
| Power Ups        | Power ups would fit well in my game and would make it more interesting while benefiting players for collecting certain items. |
| Different levels | I would like to create a set of unique levels for the player to complete, as it will keep the \[player interested.            |

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Controls         | The NES controller was designed for the NES console, but I will be developing my game for PC. Therefore I will have to have a different set of controls for keyboard and mouse. |
| Number of levels | Super Mario Bros has 32 levels across 8 different worlds, which would take lots of time to create. I would be better of spending more time on the mechanics of the game.        |
| Level System     | I want my game to consist of individual levels that you get a star rating for after you have completed it. This rating will depend on how quickly that level was completed.     |
| Life System      | For my game there will only be one life per level before you have to restart. When you die you won't have to start the entire game over, just the level.                        |

## Geometry Dash

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (1).png>)

### Overview

Geometry dash is a rhythm based platformer that was released in August 2013 by Robert Topala.  It has a PEGI rating of 3 and has been very successful since its release, surpassing 21 million in gross revenue in September 2018 [(sensortower.com, n.d.)](../reference-list.md).&#x20;

The aim of the game is to complete all of the levels without dying, and to collect all three of the hidden coins in each level. You die when you hit a wall, spike or fall off a platform, and at the end you are given a percentage score which indicates how far through the level you went. There are a large number of levels that have been created for this game, as well as multiple user-created levels. One unique aspect to this game is that each level has its own soundtrack that interacts with the level and indicates the rhythm of the jumps that the player should make. This can help the player to complete each level as the rhythm of the music often indicates the moments at which you need to move the vehicle.



### Vehicles

There are a range of different vehicles that can be used in the game, and you transform into each when you pass through a certain type of portal. Below are the main three vehicles that are used throughout the game.

![Cube](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (2).png>)

![Ship](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1) (1) (1).png>)

![Ball](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1).png>)

Each of these vehicles have their own unique movement style which adds further complexity to the game as you are required to learn how to use each individual vehicle rather than just one. This also makes the game more interesting and exciting, as you aren't stuck to just one monotonous movement pattern, which limits level design and can make the experience stale and boring.&#x20;

### Controls

Geometry dash has been released on multiple platforms, but was originally released for mobile. The controls are pretty simple and easy to lean. Each vehicle automatically moves horizontally across the level, and you control its vertical movements by tapping or holding down anywhere on the screen. These simple touch controls help the player to learn each vehicle more easily, and it usually takes just a few seconds for the player to understand each movement pattern.

| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - |
| Percentage Score         | I like this feature as it shows the progress the player is making and gives them something to work towards if they are unable to fully complete the level yet. |   |
| Simple shapes            | I will make the levels out of simple squares and triangles as it allows me to spend more time on the game mechanics.                                           |   |
| Auto horizontal movement | I like this movement style as it makes the controls simpler since you only have to  control the vertical movement.                                             |   |
| Vehicles                 | I think having multiple vehicles will make my game more interesting and allow my levels to be more unique.                                                     |   |
| Restart after death      | I want to include this feature because I think it increases the dificulty of each level just enough so that each level isn't too easy.                         |   |

| User created levels     | I think this would take too long to implement and would be too complex for what I am planning on creating.            |   |
| Number of levels        | This would also take a long time to do and I just won't have the time to create as many levels that are in this game. |   |
| Custom level soundtrack | Although I like this feature I think my time would be better spent creating other more crucial elements of the game.  |   |
| Touch Controls          | I will be creating my game on PC, so I will be using mouse and keyboard and not touch controls.                       |   |
| Hidden coins            | This element just isn't that important so I don't want to waste my time adding it.                                    |   |

### Overview

Jetpack joyride is a 2d endless runner that was developed by Halfbrick and released in 2011 on iOS. You play as Barry wgho is running through a laboratory full of scientists that are trying to kill him. The aim of the game is to progress through as far as possible while collecting as many coins as possible. These coins are then used to purchase new items in the shop. The level is randomly generated everytime you play which makes it completely replayable as you wil get a new experience everytime you play. Your high score is saved as a number which indicates how far you made it. There are different power ups that you can collect while playing, These come in the form of different vehicles that each have their own unique movement pattern. While in a vehicle Barry is shielded from taking any damage from obstacles.

### Controls

Jetpack Joyride uses touch controls to control the flight of the main character Barry. He automatically runs to the right of the screen at a fixed velocity but the vertical movement is controlled by holding down anywhere on the touch screen. There are different movement patterns depending on the vehicle you are in. This makes the game more interesting and less stale, as it creates a different aspect to the game.&#x20;

| Power ups     | I want to include this feature as it gives the player an incentive to pick up certain items and helps them progress through the level in unique ways |   |
| Auto Movement | I like this mechanic as it makes the controls very simple and easy to learn as the player only has to control the vertical movement                  |   |
| Obstacles     | Obstacles are going to be a key feature of my game and I will definitely be adding them when designing my levels                                     |   |

| Random Level generation | I would rather design unique individual levels as I think it will be easier and I can modify the difficulties of each individual level. |   |
| Coins                   | I won't be adding coins along the way as I have no intention of creating an item shop since I believe it will be a waste of my time.    |   |
| Controls                | My game will be for PC so I won't be using touch controls like the ones in this game. I will instead be using a keyboard and mouse.     |   |
