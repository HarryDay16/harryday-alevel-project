![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

### Overview

Super Mario bros is a 2D side scrolling platformer that was developed by Nintendo in 1985. It has been one of the most successful and influential games of all time, and has defined the platformer genre. It was released before PEGI or ESRB were established so it doesn't have an age rating, but newer versions of the game have received  ESRB ratings of E [(ESRB Ratings, n.d.).](../reference-list.md)

The aim of the game is to progress through all of the levels without dying, all while defeating different enemies and navigating the levels. A variety of different power ups can be picked up along the way, which can help the player to progress through the levels more easily. You start with a set amount of lives, and can gain more by collecting 100 coins, picking up a 1 up mushroom, or by bouncing on enemies consecutively. Mario loses a life if he takes damage while small, falls into a bottomless pit, or if the time runs out If you run out of lives then the game starts over from the last save point. This is a simple game concept, but has proved to be very popular over the years, as this game has sold more than 58 million copies since its release.[ (HP, 2021)](../reference-list.md)

### Controls

The original Super Mario Bros was developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), so it used the NES gamepad as its controller. The D-pad on the left side of the controller is used for directional movement , the A button is used to jump or swim up and the B button is used to run or shoot a flame. This is a very simple and easy to use controller, which lowers the complexity of the game, making it more accessible for all groups of people.

| Enemies          | By adding enemies into the game it will  make it more challenging for the player, and give them another thing to think about. |
| Power Ups        | Power ups would fit well in my game and would make it more interesting while benefiting players for collecting certain items. |
| Different levels | I would like to create a set of unique levels for the player to complete, as it will keep the \[player interested.            |

| Controls         | The NES controller was designed for the NES console, but I will be developing my game for PC. Therefore I will have to have a different set of controls for keyboard and mouse. |
| Number of levels | Super Mario Bros has 32 levels across 8 different worlds, which would take lots of time to create. I would be better of spending more time on the mechanics of the game.        |
| Level System     | I want my game to consist of individual levels that you get a star rating for after you have completed it. This rating will depend on how quickly that level was completed.     |
| Life System      | For my game there will only be one life per level before you have to restart. When you die you won't have to start the entire game over, just the level.                        |
