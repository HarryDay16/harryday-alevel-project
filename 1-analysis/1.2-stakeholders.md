# 1.2 Stakeholders

## Demographics

Gaming is becoming increasingly more popular, and video games are no longer just played by young people. The average age of video game players has increased over the last 20-30 years.  It was found during a survey that 20% of those who play are under 18; 39% are between 18 and 34; 14% are between 35 and 44; and 16% are over 55. (Clement, J. 2021). This shows how wide the age range of gamers is, and shows just how popular gaming is becoming for all age groups.

Moreover, gaming is no longer just dominated by men. It was found that "46 percent of all computer and video gamers in the United States are female. This is a significant increase from the 38 percent female gaming population in 2006"(Clemet, J. 2021). This shows that gaming is becoming a hobby that is enjoyed by everybody, regardless of what your gender is.

## PEGI Ratings

![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

PEGI ratings are the most popular form of age ratings in Europe, and give a good indicator to the consumer as to how suitable the game is for each age range.&#x20;

* The content of games with a PEGI 3 rating is considered suitable for all age groups. The game should not contain any sounds or pictures that are likely to frighten young children.
* Games with a PEGI 7 rating include scenes or sounds that may be frightening to younger children, and can include very mild forms of violence assuming it is non-realistic.
* PEGI 12 games have a slightly more graphic nature towards fantasy characters or non-realistic violence towards human-like characters. Sexual innuendo can be present, however bad language must be mild.
* A game is rated PEGI 16 when it reaches a stage that looks the same as would be expected in real life. The use of bad language can be more extreme, and the use of tobacco, alcohol or illegal drugs can also be present.
* PEGI 18 games are a depiction of gross violence and can include motiveless killing, or violence towards defenceless characters. The glamorisation of the use of illegal drugs and of the simulation of gambling, and explicit sexual activity should also fall into this age category.

(PEGI, 2017)\


I would like my game to fall into the PEGI 3 category. This is because less violent games tend to be more popular as they are more accessible to all groups of people. Many groups of people are either not allowed to play, or just don't enjoy violent games, so making a game accessible to everyone increases the number of potential stakeholders. Out of the top 10 best-selling games of all time only 2 of them had PEGI ratings of 18 and the rest were all easily accessible to all age groups. It is because of this that I want to make a game that is suitable for all ages, as it is clear that games with higher age ratings tend to perform worse than those with lower ratings (Hallman, C. 2020).
