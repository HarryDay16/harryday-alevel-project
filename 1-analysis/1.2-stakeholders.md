## Demographics

Gaming is becoming increasingly more popular, and video games are no longer just played by young people. The average age of video game players has increased over the last 20-30 years.  It was found during a survey that 20% of those who play are under 18; 39% are between 18 and 34; 14% are between 35 and 44; and 16% are over 55. (Clement, J. 2021). This shows how wide the age range of gamers is, and shows just how popular gaming is becoming for all age groups.

Moreover, gaming is no longer just dominated by men. It was found that "46 percent of all computer and video gamers in the United States are female. This is a significant increase from the 38 percent female gaming population in 2006"(Clemet, J. 2021). This shows that gaming is becoming a hobby that is enjoyed by everybody, regardless of what your gender is.
