# 1.1 Problem Identification

Playing video games can increase your focus and ability to process information. Nic Fleming stated that "individuals who played action games at least four days per week for a minimum of one hour per day were better than non-gamers at rapidly processing complex information, estimating numbers of objects, controlling where their attention was focused spatially, and switching rapidly between tasks."  As well as this Joseph Chisholm, a psychologist at the University of British Columbia, Canada, found that action video game players were better at identifying distractions and keeping focused on the main task (Fleming, 2013). This shows that video games can be extremely beneficial for improving your overall mental ability, and are therefore a very useful tools for doing so.

Gaming has also been shown to improve your happiness and overall mental health. "In 2020, research conducted by the University of Oxford found that playing video games may improve your mental health and make you happier" (Barnardo's, 2021). This is another example of how video games can be great for our mental wellbeing, which is extremely important in this current period of time. This is due to the Covid-19 pandemic that has taken place over the past 2 years, which has caused many people to struggle with their mental health. Therefore, by playing video games those who have been struggling with these issues will be able to improve their mental wellbeing due to the benefits that video games can bring.

Less violent games tend to be more popular as they are more accessible to all groups of people. This is because many groups of people are either not allowed to play, or just don't enjoy violent games. Out of the top 10 best-selling games of all time only 2 of them had PEGI ratings of 18 and the rest were all easily accessible to all age groups, which is one reason why they seem to sell better. It is because of this that I want to make a game that is suitable for most ages, as it is clear that games with higher age ratings tend to perform worse than those with lower ratings (Hallman, C. 2020).

I have also decided that I will be creating a 2D platformer. This is due to the popularity that games such as Super Mario Bros, Sonic the Hedgehog and Crash Bandicoot have had over the years. Mario is currently the 2nd highest-grossing franchise of all time, and the Super Mario Bros series has brought in a little under $15.9 billion (Hallman, C. 2020). Mario is now one of the most recognisable characters ever, showing just how popular this style of game can be.&#x20;
