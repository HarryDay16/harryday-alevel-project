| 1        | The levels will consist of platforms that are clearly visible and safe for the player to jump on | So that the player can easily see where they need to jump to and when they land there they don't take damage of any kind.                                                               | Level Design |
| 2        | Each level will have its own unique set of obstacles to navigate through.                        | This makes each level challenging and fun, and ensures that each level is a different experience for the player.                                                                        | Level Design |
| 3        |  There are three unique levels of similar length                                                 | By making the levels similar length it makes the game feel more consistent. I want each level to have a unique feel to it, as this will make my game more enjoyable.                    | Level Design |
| 4        | The levels are challenging but beatable                                                          | I want the levels to challenge the player as easy levels are very boring. However extremely difficult levels can frustrate the player so I need to find a good balance between the two. | Level Design |
| 5        | The levels include enemies                                                                       | I will include sections of the level where enemies will appear which adds an extra challenge to the game and makes it more interesting.                                                 | Level Design |
| 6        | Each level will have its own unique look                                                         | I want each level to have a unique look and feel as it keeps each experience feeling fresh and unique.                                                                                  | Level Design |

### Non-functional
