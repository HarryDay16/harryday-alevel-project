| 1        | The levels will consist of platforms that are clearly visible and safe for the player to jump on | So that the player can easily see where they need to jump to and when they land there they don't take damage of any kind.                                                               | Level Design |
| 2        | Each level will have its own unique set of obstacles to navigate through.                        | This makes each level challenging and fun, and ensures that each level is a different experience for the player.                                                                        | Level Design |
| 3        |  There are three unique levels of similar length                                                 | By making the levels similar length it makes the game feel more consistent. I want each level to have a unique feel to it, as this will make my game more enjoyable.                    | Level Design |
| 4        | The levels are challenging but beatable                                                          | I want the levels to challenge the player as easy levels are very boring. However extremely difficult levels can frustrate the player so I need to find a good balance between the two. | Level Design |
| 5        | The levels include enemies                                                                       | I will include sections of the level where enemies will appear which adds an extra challenge to the game and makes it more interesting.                                                 | Level Design |
| 6        | Each level will have its own unique look                                                         | I want each level to have a unique look and feel as it keeps each experience feeling fresh and unique.                                                                                  | Level Design |

| 7        | The game runs smoothly and without crashing | It makes the game more enjoyable to play if everything looks smooth and isn't always crashing                  |           |
| 8        | The game must be appropriate for all ages   | I want my game to be accessible to everybody no matter what their age is. I want the age rating to be PEGI 3.  |           |
| 9        | The frame rate must be at least 30 fps      | This is the minimum I want the frame rate to be as anything lower will mean the game starts to look unnatural. |           |

### User Interface

| 10       | There should be a main menu that is easy and efficient to use                | I don't want the menus to be confusing for the users, as that can be frustrating and make the game less enjoyable.                                    |           |
| 11       | There should be an option to pause and exit to menu mid game.                | Sometimes people need to pause in the middle of a game for various reasons. Having this as an option just makes the experience better for the player. |           |
| 12       | There should be a health bar in game that is clear for the player to see.    | The player should understand what is going on at all times, so it is important that the health is clearly displayed at all times.                     |           |
| 13       | There should be a saving system so that players keep track of their progress | By tracking high scores this keeps the player motivated to play and to try and beat their personal record                                             |           |

### Mechanics

| 14       | Collision Detection               | Collision Detection is an important feature as it allows different objects to interact with each other and the game will be able to tell when two things come into contact.                                   |           |
| 15       | Physics Engine                    | A physics engine will need to be implemented in order to control the gravity in my game. This will make each jump feel more natural and make it easier for the player to predict where the vehicle will land. |           |
| 16       | Auto movement at a fixed velocity | For my game to function the vehicle will need to move automatically to the right of the screen at a constant speed. This is so that the player will only have to control the vertical movement                |           |
| 17       | Controls                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                               |           |
