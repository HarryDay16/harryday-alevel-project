| 1        | The levels will consist of platforms that are clearly visible and safe for the player to jump on | So that the player can easily see where they need to jump to and when they land there they don't take damage of any kind.                                                                                                      | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#level-design">Level Design</a></li></ul>                                                                                     |
| 2        | The level will contain spikes that the player must avoid                                         | This makes each level challenging and fun, and ensures that each level is a different experience for the player.                                                                                                               | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#level-design">Level Design</a></li></ul>                                                                                     |
| 3        | The level should be a suitable length.                                                           | The level shouldn't be too short or too long, and I need to find a good balance where the player doesn't become bored, but also feels that it was a sufficient length. This makes it a better overall experience for the user. | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#level-design">Level Design</a></li></ul>                                                                                     |
| 4        | The levels are challenging but beatable                                                          | I want the levels to challenge the player as easy levels are very boring. However extremely difficult levels can frustrate the player so I need to find a good balance between the two.                                        | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#level-design">Level Design</a></li></ul>                                                                                     |
| 5        | The levels include enemies                                                                       | I will include sections of the level where enemies will appear which adds an extra challenge to the game and makes it more interesting.                                                                                        | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#level-design">Level Design</a></li><li><a href="1.3-research-the-problem.md#super-mario-bros">Super Mario Bros</a></li></ul> |
| 6        | The level will have a minimalistic style that still looks good.                                  | I want the game to look good without me having to dedicate lots of time into designing the levels and sprites. This will  allow me to spend longer on the mechanics and other more important aspects of the game.              | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#level-design">Level Design</a></li></ul>                                                                                     |

| 7        | The game runs smoothly and without crashing | It makes the game more enjoyable to play if everything looks smooth and isn't always crashing                  | <ul><li><a href="1.4b-computational-methods.md">Computational methods</a></li></ul> |
| 8        | The game must be appropriate for all ages   | I want my game to be accessible to everybody no matter what their age is. I want the age rating to be PEGI 3.  | <ul><li><a href="1.2-stakeholders.md#pegi-ratings">PEGI</a></li></ul>               |
| 9        | The frame rate must be at least 30 fps      | This is the minimum I want the frame rate to be as anything lower will mean the game starts to look unnatural. | <ul><li><a href="1.4b-computational-methods.md">Computational methods</a></li></ul> |

### User Interface

| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10       | There should be a main menu that is easy and efficient to use             | I don't want the menus to be confusing for the users, as that can be frustrating and make the game less enjoyable.                                    | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics-and-user-interface">User interface</a></li></ul> |
| 11       | There should be an option to pause and exit to menu mid game.             | Sometimes people need to pause in the middle of a game for various reasons. Having this as an option just makes the experience better for the player. | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics-and-user-interface">User interface</a></li></ul> |
| 12       | There should be a health bar in game that is clear for the player to see. | The player should understand what is going on at all times, so it is important that the health is clearly displayed at all times.                     | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#user-interface">User interface</a></li></ul>              |
| 13       | The player should get a percentage score at the end of the game.          | By displaying the score that the user gets it keeps the player motivated to play and to try and beat their personal record                            | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#user-interface">User interface</a></li></ul>              |

| 14       | Collision Detection               | Collision Detection is an important feature as it allows different objects to interact with each other and the game will be able to tell when two things come into contact.                                   | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#mechanics">Mechanics</a></li><li><a href="1.3-research-the-problem.md#geometry-dash">Geometry Dash</a></li></ul>                                                                                    |
| 15       | Physics Engine                    | A physics engine will need to be implemented in order to control the gravity in my game. This will make each jump feel more natural and make it easier for the player to predict where the vehicle will land. | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#mechanics">Mechanics</a></li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 16       | Auto movement at a fixed velocity | For my game to function the vehicle will need to move automatically to the right of the screen at a constant speed. This is so that the player will only have to control the vertical movement                | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#mechanics">Mechanics </a></li><li><a href="1.3-research-the-problem.md#geometry-dash">Geometry Dash</a></li><li><a href="1.3-research-the-problem.md#jetpack-joyride">Jetpack Joyride</a></li></ul> |
| 17       | Movement Controls                 | These controls should be simple and easy to learn. This will make the game more enjoyable and the player doesn't have to take a long time to learn the controls                                               | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#mechanics">Mechanics</a></li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 18       | Shooting                          | There should be a mechanic included in the game which allows the player to shoot lasers at the enemies. This will add another thing for the player to think about and make the game more interesting.         | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#mechanics">Mechanics</a></li><li><a href="1.3-research-the-problem.md#super-mario-bros">Super Mario Bros</a></li></ul><p></p>                                                                       |
