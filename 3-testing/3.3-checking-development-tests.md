# 3.3 Checking Development Tests

## Testing for Cycle 1

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect                          | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code     | The level and the character to appear. | As expected           | Pass      |

### Evidence

After running the code this appeared on the screen. This was the only test I had to complete in the first cycle and it was passed.



## Testing for Cycle 2

| Test | Instructions                        | What I expect to happen        | What actually happened | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run the game                        | The main menu screen to appear | As expected            | Pass      |
| 2    | Click on the text                   | The game to begin              | As expected            | Pass      |
| 3    | Click around the text but not on it | The game should not begin      | As expected            | Pass      |

### Evidence for Testing

#### Test 1

After running the game the menu screen appeared as expected. This test was therefore a success.

#### Test 2

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After clicking on the text the game scene appeared. This test was also a success.

#### Test 3

I added this test to ensure that the buttons hitbox wasn't too large and that it functioned correctly. I tried clicking everywhere around the button and the game scene never appeared. Therefore this test was also successful.



## Testing for Cycle 3

| Test | Instructions        | What I expect to happen                        | What actually happened | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run Code            | The square to move and the camera to follow    | as expected            | Pass      |
| 2    | Press the Space bar | The character to jump when it is on the floor  | as expected            | Pass      |

### Evidence of Testing

#### Test 1

Here you can see that the square has moved across the level and the camera has followed it.  It currently passes through the spikes and over the gaps. I will change this in later cycles.

#### Test 2

Test 2 was a success, and you can see the square jumping while it moves through the level. I also tried pressing the space bar while it was in the air and it did not jump a second time.
