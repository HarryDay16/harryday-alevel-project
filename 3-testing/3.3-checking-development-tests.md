After running the game the menu screen appeared as expected. This test was therefore a success.

#### Test 2

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (27).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After clicking on the text the game scene appeared. This test was also a success.

#### Test 3

I added this test to ensure that the buttons hitbox wasn't too large and that it functioned correctly. I tried clicking everywhere around the button and the game scene never appeared. Therefore this test was also successful.

Here you can see that the square has moved across the level and the camera has followed it. This test is passed.

#### Test 2

Instead of individually testing all the different sections like before I just ran the whole game to see if I could beat it. After 2 attempts I completed the game and reached the portal.

Here you can see that the portal did appear at the end of the level. Therefore this test was a success.

After coming into contact with the portal I was instantly sent to the win screen which is shown above. This test was passed.
