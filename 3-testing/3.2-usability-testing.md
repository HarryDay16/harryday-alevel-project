# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Do you know how to complete the game? Do you know what areas are safe to land on?           |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the menus easy and simple to navigate? Did you waste lots of time navigating the menus? |
| 3 - Engaging       | Is the game enjoyable? Does the game look good? Was the game too easy and boring?           |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Are there any bugs in the game? Did the game crash? Did it run smoothly?                    |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Were you able to figure out the controls easily? Was the level too difficult?               |

### Effective

I asked this question as it is important to know if the users understood what parts of the level they had to avoid and what areas were safe to land on. I am happy with the result of this question as the majority of people said that they understood where was safe to land on.

### Efficient

This question was important as if the menus are difficult to navigate it wastes the users' time and makes the game more frustrating to play. Once again I am pleased with the outcome here, with all but two respondents agreeing with the statement and 40% saying that they strongly agreed.

### Engaging

#### Question 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This was the most important question I asked as it almost covers almost every aspect of the game and brings it all into one simple question. I was very happy to see that 90% of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed with the above statement, showing that despite any flaws my game may have it is still an enjoyable experience for the users.

#### Question 2

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question had more mixed answers, however the majority of respondents still said that they agreed with the statement. This set of answers is understandable as I tried not to focus on the aesthetics of the game and instead focused on creating a game that was functional and engaging.&#x20;

### Error Tolerant

#### Question 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I was very pleased with this result, and it shows that my game runs well on multiple devices and didn't crash on a single one.

#### Question 2

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criteria | Description                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 4        | The game is challenging but beatable |
| 8        | The game is appropriate for all ages |

### Criterion 4
