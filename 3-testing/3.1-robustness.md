# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

Find success criteria that relate to function and robustness

| Criterion | Description                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 7         | The game runs smoothly and without crashing |
| 8         | It should run at a minimum of 30 fps        |

### Criterion 7

The reason for testing criterion 7 is to ensure that the game is fully playable, and that it will not break mid way through the level. This improves the usability of the game, and makes it more enjoyable for the user.&#x20;

In order to test this I ran the game multiple times on a variety of different computers and web browsers, throwing in as many inputs as I could to see whether I could get it to crash. This ensures that the game is playable on all devices, and that no matter what the user inputs the game will not crash while it is being played.&#x20;

After trying multiple times I never managed to get the game to break. However, as I put the game under more stress the screen started to jitter more and more, and this seemed to occur more often on older computers. This is mostly expected though, as older computers aren't able to run games as well as newer ones, due to them having older, lower-spec components.&#x20;

### Criterion 8

This criterion is important to test as if the game is running below 30 fps it starts to become choppy and jittery. Therefore, it is important that the game runs at a suitable frame rate as this ensures that the game is playable and the user doesn't find the experience frustrating.

Testing the fps was very simple as kaboom already has debug tools that allow you to pause and check the frame rate. To do this all I had to do was press the f1 key while running the game, and it would show the hitboxes and frame rate of the game.

&#x20;When I tested this it said the game was running at 32 fps, which is just over the minimum frame rate I wanted in my specification. Therefore the game has passed this test.
