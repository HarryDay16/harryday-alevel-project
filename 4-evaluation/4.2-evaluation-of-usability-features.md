# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                                       | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Clear goal to avoid the spikes and enemies                        | Success      |
| 2           | Clear goal to progress as far as possible and beat previous score | Success      |

### Feature 1

The spikes and enemies were effective as it was clear that they needed to be avoided due to their design. I made the enemies and spikes bright red, while the platforms that were safe to land on were black, allowing the player to easily distinguish between them. I see no need to change this in future development.

### Feature 2

The addition of the percentage score makes the game more effective as it gives the user a clear goal, which is to try and beat their previous high score. This goal is easy to understand and makes the user want to continue playing in order to get the highest score possible. This is an essential part of the game and it will not be changed in the future.

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | Menus that are simple and easy to navigate | Success      |
| 2           | Concise Controls                           | Success      |

### Feature 1

The menus are very basic, however this makes them extremely easy to navigate. I am happy with how they turned out, and the styling fits the game well. This will remain as it is in future development.

### Feature 2

The controls are very concise and the space bar is the only key that is used to control the player character. I think the controls I have implemented suit the game very well and I have no intention of changing them in the future.&#x20;

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description          | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Suitable game length | Success      |
| 2           | Art style            | Success      |

### Feature 1

The game lasts just over thirty seconds, which I think is a good length and leaves the player feeling satisfied. This was proved true when I received feedback from the users, and it seemed that they all agreed that the game was a suitable length. No changes need to be made in regard to the duration of the game.

### Feature 2

Almost all of the users said that they enjoyed the art style despite it being pretty minimalistic. I used bright, contrasting colours and tried to make everything look smooth. I also enjoy how the game looks, and I won't be changing it in the future.

## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description                    | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | The game did not crash         | Success      |
| 2           | There were no bugs in the game | Fail         |

### Feature 1

After rigorously testing the game and putting it through stress on different machines it did not crash once. I also had no reports from any users of it crashing. I will ensure this remains the same in the future.

### Feature 2

Unfortunately there were bugs within the game. The main issue was that the hitboxes on the enemies were too large and they felt out of proportion. This was due to me importing the enemy sprite from an external website. In the future I intend on redesigning the enemies in the same way I did the other sprites, which should allow me to keep the hitboxes in proportion.

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description          | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Easy to use controls | Success      |

### Feature 1

As previously mentioned the controls are very concise and efficient, which also means that the player doesn't have to spend lots of time learning the different controls and are able to just jump in and play straightaway.
