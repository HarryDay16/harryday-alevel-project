# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* Platform Support - Currently the game can only be played on a computer in a browser
* Levels - There is currently only one long level, however in the future I would like to design more
* Graphics - Currently very simple and despite them looking good I think I could improve them
* Performance - The game runs between 30 and 40 fps but I would like to improve this to over 60 fps

These are quite easy fixes/improvements to make, and with more time spent on the project I am confident I could introduce these into the game. Implementing these changes would allow the game to expand significantly.

## Maintenance

Currently I only have some minor bug fixes to address. But if the game expands in the future and I implement the changes stated above then maintenance could become more complicated and time-consuming, and I would need to introduce new strategies to address the issues.

### Current Size

Assuming that the game remains the same size and no more features are added I will only need to follow the short-term development plan. To address the current bugs in the game would be very simple, and would most likely require only one more development cycle which will involve making small changes to the code and the game sprites. This will be carried out by myself as I am very familiar with the code and understand the changes that need to be implemented as well as where the issues stem from.&#x20;

### Room for Growth

To allow the game to grow I would first need to complete the short-term development plan, and address any minor bugs that are currently in the game. After this I will need to assess the current limitations of the game and figure out the best way to improve each one. I will need to remain aware of any new issues or bugs these future developments may cause, and deal with them effectively.&#x20;

To introduce new  would be a more time consuming process and would require more effort as well as increased game maintenance. However, they are not difficult changes to make, and with another 4 or 5 dev cycles following the same format as before I know introduce these changes effectively.&#x20;
