# Cycle 4

## Design

### Objectives

* [x] Create a health bar that decreases when the player is hit by an enemy
* [x] Add enemies into the level that shoot at the player
* [x] Add a mechanic into the game that allows the player to shoot at the enemies on the screen by clicking the mouse



### Usability Features

Controls - will be extremely simple and will be using the space bar to make the character jump. This makes the controls very easy to understand so the player doesn't have to spend a long amount of time learning how they work.
