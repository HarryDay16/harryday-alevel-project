# Cycle 4 -  Power ups

## Design

### Objectives

In this section I will be adding power ups to the game

### Usability Features

Visibility - I want to make each object in the game clearly visible and will be doing this by picking colours that contrast to each other. This will help the player to see each object in the game more easily.

### Pseudocode

```
When sprite collides with power up {
    random power up box appears at (10,10)
    when "z" is pressed {
        use power up
        remove power up box
    }
}
```
